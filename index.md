I am currently a PhD candidate in the Department of [Industrial and Enterprise Systems Engineering](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ise.illinois.edu%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFl7teOyFoHifB6cjmWrwg_JQTDeA) (ISE) at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fillinois.edu%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNG7p23JV2YoNByAfw2bu3Id7DtAjA) (UIUC).

I received a M.S. in Mathematics at the University of Pierre and Marie Curie in 2015 and a B.S. in Mathematics at the Tsinghua University in 2014.

My research interest lies in inventory management, revenue management, supply chain management, (discrete) convex analysis, approximation algorithms, and game theory.
