I will join David Simchi-Levi's [Data Science Lab](https://dsl.mit.edu/) at MIT as a postdoctoral associate in January 2021.

I received a PhD degree in Industrial Engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2020. Prior to that, I received a MS degree in Mathematics from the University of Pierre and Marie Curie in 2015 and a BS degree in Mathematics from the Tsinghua University in 2014.

My research interests include inventory management, revenue management, (discrete) convex analysis, combinatorial optimization, approximation algorithms, game theory, and data-driven decision making.
