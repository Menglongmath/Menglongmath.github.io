I am currently an Assistant Professor in the Department of [Management Sciences](https://www.cb.cityu.edu.hk/ms/) at the City University of Hong Kong. Before joining CityU, I am a postdoctoral associate in David Simchi-Levi's [Data Science Lab](https://dsl.mit.edu) at MIT. I received a PhD degree in Operations Research from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, a MS degree in Mathematics from the University of Pierre and Marie Curie and a BS degree in Mathematics from the Tsinghua University.


My research interests include
* inventory management and revenue management
* (discrete) convex analysis, combinatorial optimization, approximation algorithms, game theory, and data-driven decision-making




## Openings

I am looking for self-motivated Ph.D. students interested in operations research and optimization, with potential applications in inventory management and revenue management. Prospective students with **strong mathematical backgrounds** are welcome to email me a CV and transcript. Students majoring in mathematics are especially welcome.
